          DICTIONARY
             OF

UNABRIDGED FROM THE ORIGINAL 1811 EDITION WITH A FOREWORD BY
ROBERT CROMIE

COMPILED ORIGINALLY BY CAPTAIN GROSE.

AND NOW CONSIDERABLY ALTERED AND ENLARGED, WITH THE MODERN
CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS, BY A MEMBER OF THE WHIP CLUB.

ASSISTED BY HELL-FIRE DICK, AND JAMES GORDON,
ESQRS. OF CAMBRIDGE; AND WILLIAM SOAMES, ESQ. OF
THE HON. SOCIETY OF NEWMAN'S HOTEL.





PREFACE.

The merit of Captain Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue has
been long and universally acknowledged. But its circulation was
confined almost exclusively to the lower orders of society: he
was not aware, at the time of its compilation, that our young men
of fashion would at no very distant period be as distinguished
for the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate;
and he therefore conceived it superfluous to incorporate with his
work the few examples of fashionable slang that might occur to
his observation.

But our Jehus of rank have a phraseology not less peculiar to
themselves, than the disciples of Barrington: for the uninitiated
to understand their modes of expression, is as impossible as for
a Buxton to construe the Greek Testament. To sport an Upper
Benjamin, and to swear with a good grace, are qualifications
easily attainable by their cockney imitators; but without the aid
of our additional definitions, neither the cits of Fish-street,
nor the boors of Brentford would be able to attain the language
of whippism. We trust, therefore, that the whole tribe of
second-rate Bang Ups, will feel grateful for our endeavour to render
this part of the work as complete as possible. By an occasional
reference to our pages, they may be initiated into all the
peculiarities of language by which the man of spirit is
distinguished from the man of worth. They may now talk bawdy
before their papas, without the fear of detection, and abuse
their less spirited companions, who prefer a good dinner at home
to a glorious UP-SHOT in the highway, without the hazard of a
cudgelling.

But we claim not merely the praise of gratifying curiosity, or
affording assistance to the ambitious; we are very sure that the
moral influence of the Lexicon Balatronicum will be more certain
and extensive than that of any methodist sermon that has ever
been delivered within the bills of mortality. We need not descant
on the dangerous impressions that are made on the female mind, by
the remarks that fall incidentally from the lips of the brothers
or servants of a family; and we have before observed, that
improper topics can with our assistance be discussed, even before
the ladies, without raising a blush on the cheek of modesty. It
is impossible that a female should understand the meaning of
TWIDDLE DIDDLES, or rise from table at the mention of BUCKINGER'S
BOOT. Besides, Pope assures us, that "VICE TO BE HATED NEEDS BUT
TO BE SEEN;" in this volume it cannot be denied, that she is seen
very plainly; and a love of virtue is, therefore, the necessary
result of perusing it.

The propriety of introducing the UNIVERSITY SLANG will be readily
admitted; it is not less curious than that of the College in the
Old
Bailey, and is less generally understood. When the number and
accuracy of our additions are compared with the price of the
volume, we have no doubt that its editors will meet with the
encouragement that is due to learning, modesty, and virtue.

  They pretend that they derive their origin from the
  ancient Egyptians, who were famous for their knowledge
  in astronomy and other sciences; and, under the pretence
  of fortune-telling, find means to rob or defraud the ignorant
  and superstitious. To colour their impostures, they
  artificially discolour their faces, and speak a kind of
  gibberish peculiar to themselves. They rove up and down the
  country in large companies, to the great terror of the
  farmers, from whose geese, turkeys, and fowls, they take very
  considerable contributions.

  When a fresh recruit is admitted into the fraternity, he is to
   take the following oath, administered by the principal
   maunder, after going through the annexed forms:

  First, a new name is given him by which he is ever after to
   be called; then standing up in the middle of the assembly,
   and directing his face to the dimber damber, or principal
   man of the gang, he repeats the following oath, which is
   dictated to him by some experienced member of the fraternity:

  I, Crank Cuffin, do swear to be a true brother, and that I will
   in all things obey the commands of the great tawney
   prince, and keep his counsel and not divulge the secrets of
   my brethren.

  I will never leave nor forsake the company, but observe and
   keep all the times of appointment, either by day or by
   night, in every place whatever.

  I will not teach any one to cant, nor will I disclose any of
   our mysteries to them.

  I will take my prince's part against all that shall oppose him,
   or any of us, according to the utmost of my ability; nor
   will I suffer him, or any one belongiug to us, to be abused
   by any strange abrams, rufflers, hookers, pailliards,
   swaddlers, Irish toyles, swigmen, whip jacks, jarkmen,
   bawdy baskets, dommerars, clapper dogeons, patricoes,
   or curtals; but will defend him, or them, as much as I
   can, against all other outliers whatever. I will not conceal
   aught I win out of libkins or from the ruffmans, but
   will preserve it for the use of the company. Lastly, I
   will cleave to my doxy wap stiffly, and will bring her
   duds, marjery praters, goblers, grunting cheats, or tibs
   of the buttery, or any thing else I can come at, as
   winnings for her weppings.

  The canters have, it seems, a tradition, that from the three
   first articles of this oath, the first founders of a certain
   boastful, worshipful fraternity (who pretend to derive their
   origin from the earliest times) borrowed both the hint and
   form of their establishment; and that their pretended
   derivation from the first Adam is a forgery, it being only
   from the first Adam Tiler: see ADAM TILER. At the
   admission of a new brother, a general stock is raised for
   booze, or drink, to make themselves merry on the occasion.
   As for peckage or eatables, they can procure without
   money; for while some are sent to break the ruffmans,
   or woods and bushes, for firing, others are detached to
   filch geese, chickens, hens, ducks (or mallards), and pigs.
   Their morts are their butchers, who presently make
   bloody work with what living things are brought them; and
   having made holes in the ground under some remote hedge
   in an obscure place, they make a fire and boil or broil their
   food; and when it is enough, fall to work tooth and nail:
   and having eaten more like beasts than men, they drink
   more like swine than human creatures, entertaining one
   another all the time with songs in the canting dialect.

  As they live, so they lie, together promiscuously, and know
   not how to claim a property either in their goods or children:
   and this general interest ties them more firmly together
   than if all their rags were twisted into ropes, to bind
   them indissolubly from a separation; which detestable
   union is farther consolidated by the above oath.

  They stroll up and down all summer-time in droves, and
   Dexterously pick pockets, while they are telling of fortunes;
   and the money, rings, silver thirribles, &c. which they
   get, are instantly conveyed from one hand to another,
   till the remotest person of the gang (who is not suspected
   because they come not near the person robbed) gets possession
   of it; so that, in the strictest search, it is impossible to
   recover it; while the wretches with imprecations,
   oaths, and protestations, disclaim the thievery.

  That by which they are said to get the most money, is,
   when young gentlewomen of good families and reputation
   have happened to be with child before marriage, a round
   sum is often bestowed among the gypsies, for some one
   mort to take the child; and as that is never heard of
   more by the true mother and family, so the disgrace is
   kept concealed from the world; and, if the child lives, it
   never knows its parents.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
